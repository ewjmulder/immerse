# Immerse

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ewjmulder/immerse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ewjmulder/immerse)

Immerse yourself in the waves of dynamic surround sound!

## Use Cases

Immerse is a perfect fit for:
* An escape / adventure room with realistic audio effects
* An audio enhanced display at an event, conference or museum
* An (interactive) audio(visual) art installation or exhibition
* Any room with some speakers and a demand for a cool audio experience

Immerse is no fit for:
* Big commercial projects that require support agreements

## Features

* Play any number of audio scenarios over a collection of speakers distributed across a room
* Stream audio to an unlimited amount* of speakers simultaneously
* Scenarios can respond on events dynamically and in real time
* Works well on cheap computer, sound card and speaker hardware

(*) Tested with up to 12 speakers, (a lot) more should be no problem

## Getting Started

Read the [Getting Started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) section of the documentation.

## Modules

For implementation details on the different modules, see:
* [Domain - Data modeling with extensible interfaces](domain/README.md)
* [Toolbox - Provided implementations for the domain interfaces](toolbox/README.md)
* [Audio Streaming - The heart of Immerse](audio-streaming/README.md)

## Releases

* 0.5.0-ALPHA - 2018-05-01 - It contains all the needed functionality to start using it, but has limited guarantee on stability and robustness.

## Road Map

* 0.8.0-BETA will contain some more features, bug fixes and a more stable system in general. It is planned for autumn 2018.
* 1.0.0 will be feature complete for general usage of the library and should be stable enough to use in real life situations. It does not have a planned release date yet.
