# Immerse - Getting Started

This section is limited for now and will be expanded in the future.

If you are really planning to use Immerse already, please contact me through a Github issue or the email address that you can find in my commits. 

## Hardware requirements

* Computer for running the software. Can be a simple [SBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) like the [Pine64](https://www.pine64.org/). Testing on a Raspberry Pi 3 has not been successful yet. Can also be a regular desktop / laptop computer.
* Speakers for audio output. Can be any combination of speakers distributed across a room. But preferably the speakers are identical, simple (cheap) speakers. For instance [Trust Leto](https://www.trust.com/en/product/19830-leto-2-0-speaker-set-black) has been tested and works well. It's recommended to use speakers that do not need a button to be pressed after power comes back on and that 'save' their volume setting, so behavior is consistent after turning power off and on again.
* Sound Cards for translating the digital sound into analog signals. Can be very simple and cheap USB sound cards, like you can find [here](http://www.dx.com/s/usb%2bsound%2bcard?cateId=0&cateName=All%20Categories&PriceSort=up). You will need 1 sound card per 2 speakers.
* USB Hub for connecting all the sound cards to the computer. If you have more USB sound cards then USB ports in your computer, you will also need a (powered) USB Hub. For SBC computers it is recommended to use one specifically designed for them, like [this one](https://thepihut.com/products/7-port-usb-hub-for-the-raspberry-pi).
* Audio extension cables for connecting the speakers to the computer. Probably the speaker audio cables will not be long enough, so you will need audio extension cables.
* Power sockets or power cable extensions for the speakers. Every set of speakers needs a power socket. Either close enough to directly plug it in or you need a power cable extension. Depending on your speaker that can be a regular power cord extension or a USB extension cable. For USB powered speakers you will also need a USB power adapter like [these](http://www.dx.com/s/usb%2bpower%2badapter?cateId=0&cateName=All%20Categories&PriceSort=up).



TODO: write more about how to get started with an actual application.
