Steps taken / notes:
- Get Xenial Base image from Pine64 site and put it on a SD card
- Boot the Pine64 with this card in it.
  NB: If you want an image, use a Television on 'Scan only' HDMI mode to get an image on screen (might need a reboot or 2)
  NB2: No screen needed, SSH works after boot
  NB3: Have a network cable attached at boot time, otherwise you'll get a 5 min boot time timeout on trying to connect
- Enlarge the partition to full SD card capacity, see commands on Pine64 site
- Set the timezone: sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
- Update uboot, kernel, etc, see command on Pine64 site
- sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
- install Java: Oracle JDK is headless without sound support. Open JDK... ?
- With both installed, use 'sudo update-alternatives --config java' and 'sudo update-alternatives --config javac' to set version to OpenJDK (might not persist over reboots)
  NB: Does work for path, but does not work for Gradle. Set JAVA_HOME to openjdk folder.
- When running with OpenJDK it still reports HEADLESS, probably because the runtime is headless, but the binaries contain more (working) libs, such as sound.
  Unfortunately, this still is not enough, since now just 1 mixewr is found: PulseAudio.
  We need to tell openjdk to use alsa, which can be done in the jre/lib/sound.properties file
  
  ARGHHHHHH: the problem was just we should run as root!!!!
- Add your user to be in the audo group: sudo usermod -a -G audio ubuntu
  NB: after that: relogin with SSH
  NB2: After that: JAVA_HOME will be back to oracle. So either set it to always openjdk or do not install oracle jdk
- Test: switch back to Oracle JDK: does still not work! We actually do need openjdk!
- So with user in audio group, JAVA_HOME and java to openjdk we can actually play!
